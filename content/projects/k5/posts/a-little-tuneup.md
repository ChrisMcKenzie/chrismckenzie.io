Mind the grease, this k5 came to me with a 350ci small block chevy (sbc) from an mid
80s passenger car from what I can gather. looking at the vin this k5 was 
originally equipped with a 400ci sbc (bit of a bummer that isn't still in it)
but this engine runs decent and will remain there until I can figure out what to
put in it. 

In the mean time this engine needed a small tuneup, namely in the ignition category
at first the engine has a slight miss which I determined was just a fouled plug
due to the electric choke not being hooked up and being flooded on start replaced
the plugs and that resolved that but the I wanted to see where the timing was
so I put a timing light on it and found that the advance mechanism was not working,
I quickly jumped on Jegs and found an entire kit for a replacement distributor
for very reasonable, it even came with plug wires. 

I received the parts and put them in and now this truck is running very smooth
still not a ton of power but we will work on that.
