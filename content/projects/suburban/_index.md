I bought this 1990 Suburban 2500 at the end of 2017 with the goal of turning it
in to the ultimate overlanding vehicle for me and my family to travel and go
camping in. 

It originally had a 350ci TBI gen II small block that had a bunch of issues, so I removed it
and I am currently planning on an swapping in an LS series motor and a beefier 
4L80e transmission.
