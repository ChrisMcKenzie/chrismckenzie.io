I am a huge fan of markdown, you might even call me obsessed, 
I write everything in it why in fact this very piece of text 
is written it. Markdown is elegant and readable no matter how 
you are viewing it, whether you are viewing rendered up in to 
some beautiful html or just clicking raw on github, no matter 
how you look at it it's always legible.

Because of Markdown's beauty I believe that it should be used 
for any sort of documenting of any kind and I am pretty sure a 
lot of you agree with me.
