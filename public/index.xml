      <description>So it has been a while since I last touched on the problem of deploying software to a server, with that being said I have had a chance to really dig in and find a solution that is flexible as well as simple for developers to setup.
The Idea So when I started down this path of finding a clean deployment flow for my company (The Control Group) I had a few requirements It had to work for all of the different types of applications and languages that we build; I also did not want to use web hooks they are just too clunky and you have to have a server that is accesible on the internet so it can be called (not really a fan); The last thing that I wanted to be able to do is to deploy multiple versions of an application.</description>

      <description>Recently I have been building a lot of go applications, and I think I have come up with a good pattern for building an app that is ready for deployment to either a server or to users. This includes build/run for development, testing, dependency management, and packaging. While this process is still being actively developed I believe it is at a state in which to share.
The Structure I keep a very simple structure for my projects and it is as follows.</description>
